 - Liquidity Ratios

      - Net Stable Funding ratio seeks to calculate the proportion of Available Stable Funding ("ASF") via the liabilities over Required Stable Funding ("RSF") for the assets. Sources of Available Stable funding includes: customer deposits, long-term wholesale funding (from the interbank lending market), and equity.

         - To complement its “Principles for Sound Liquidity ”Risk Management and Supervision, the Basel Committee has further strengthened its liquidity framework by developing two minimum standards for funding liquidity:

           - Increased Short-term Liquidity Coverage: Since Basel Committee expects many institutions to face a liquidity challenge, it has introduced new requirements for liquidity. A 30-day Liquidity Coverage Ratio is intended to ensure that banks have short-term resilience.
           - Increased Long-term Balance Sheet Funding: The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is designed to encourage banks to move towards a more stable structure by using more stable sources to fund their activities rather than depending on short term wholesale funding.
